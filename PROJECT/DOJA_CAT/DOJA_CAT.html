  <p>Doja Cat's prominence in the music scene has consisted of viral music videos such as "MOO" which harkens back to "The Real Slim Shady" music antidotes
    which features him working at the Burger King. "Moo" the video is silly, light, and fun while the rhythm is "smooth". This singer pairs well with other LA artists
    such as Tyler the Creator as well as New York female rap legends like Niki Minaj and Li Kim with her ecentric and sexy wardrobe choices. Doja Cat is as fun to look
  at as she is to listen to which makes anytime she is performing a true show!
